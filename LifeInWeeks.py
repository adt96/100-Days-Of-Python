"""
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
Hint
There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.
